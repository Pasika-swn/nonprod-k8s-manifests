An this workshop application that follows this pattern can be found at the following Git repositories:
- Source Code: [Link](https://github.com/jojo-saritrat/app-templates)

The second repository contains Kubernetes manifests and is the one that is monitored by the GitOps controller that is running inside the cluster.
